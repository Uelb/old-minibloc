    getting_started: |
      Hello there, the Mocti team is glad that you want to try this awesome system.
      Mocti will allow you to send sms from your own server, website, and get the delivery reports and the answers of the system. 
      It is designed as a REST API and a swagger documentation is available. So if those words means something to you, go to http://swagger.wordnik.com and use the url doc http://www.mocti.fr/api/api-docs.
      If they don't, it is ok ! Just read this documentation !
      There is 2 ways of sending SMS, using your own phones, or using the MOCTI phones, in both cases, you will need an API key to communicate with our server.
      Contact our team to ask for one.
    send_a_message : |
      To send a message, you have to do a HTTP POST request to our servers, whose specifications are below :
      <i>Method: POST
      Url: http://www.mocti.fr/messages
      Data: {recipient: '0123456789', body: 'test', api_key: '{YOUR API KEY}'}</i>
