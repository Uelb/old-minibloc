      Hello there, the Minibloc team is glad that you want to try this awesome system.
      Minibloc will allow you to send sms from your own server, website, and get the delivery reports and the answers of the system. 
      It is designed as a REST API and a swagger documentation is available. So if those words means something to you, go to http://swagger.wordnik.com and use the url doc http://www.minibloc.fr/api/api-docs.
      If they don't, it is ok ! Just read this documentation !
      There is 2 ways of sending SMS, using your own phones, or using the MINIBLOC phones, in both cases, you will need an API key to communicate with our server.
      Contact our team to ask for one.

      Url: http://www.minibloc.fr/messages
      Data: {message: {recipient: '0123456789', body: 'test'}, api_key: '{YOUR API KEY}'}</i>

      <strong>Listen to the status changed event</strong>
      In your account setting, you may have noticed that there is a field called event_base_url. Our servers will use this url to post the new status to your server.
      If the event base url is "http://www.example.com", then our server will send a POST request to "http://www.example.fr/status" with the parameters below :
      <i>Method: POST
      Url: http://www.example.com/status
      Data: {message_id: 11, status_id: 0}</i>
      You can then manage this answer freely.
